# server-c
Small c server, capable of processing simple web pages. These pages may contain images and certain files. In addition, it has a persistence service to keep connections active for a certain period of time, and also incorporates the use of cookies to manage access and requests.  
Usage: ./executable-name [port] [server_directory] 
I recommend testing with the index.html file provided in the repository.
